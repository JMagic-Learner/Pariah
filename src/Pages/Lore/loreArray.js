This property allowed civilzations to advance technology such as the bridger spacecraft. Value and speculation on open markets forced political entities into a all-out corporate war. ",
        text2: "The war ended around 10 years ago. Due to disrupted supply lines and the inability to extract Gems efficiently on a mass scale, technological advancement has atrophied."

Given the disruption in Gem supply, Varyyk Industries is shifted from production of thier trademark bridger format drive to the maintenance and preservation of the bridger drives that remain. ",

They maintain a number of deep space mining platforms around the Tenebris system, although they have almost lost the entire south east sector to pirates. Just prior to the Gem War, the UMC was competing with other major mining companies for exclusive rights to Gem extraction. Many surviving denizens of the Tenebris system indirectly blame UMC and other like-minded mining coalitions for kickstarting the Gem race into a hot war.",
        text2: "The UMC played a pivotal role in the closing conflicts of the Gem War. Outfitting their mining frigates with WMDs, they cold jumped many frigates behind enemy lines to later remotely detonate. While an effective strategy at first, the use of WMDS prompted other corporations to respond in kind, clearly demolishing both manpower and resources on all fronts of the Gem War."

The refractive properties of Gems allowed JT Inc to create new telecommunicaion chips that pushed the envelope on interstellar relay speed. Seeing Gems as the lifeblood of the neo-synthetic chipware, Judeas Telecoms entered the Gem War with the idea that they can secure a couple of dig sites and hold out until things cool down. Unfortunately, war never goes according to plan, and JT Inc was reduced to a shadow of it's former self, as it's territorial holdings were subject to hostile takeovers by other corporate superpowers. Judeas Telecommunications is now limited to five worlds in the Tenebris system, one of which is their corporate headquarters (Uriel II)",
        text2: "Despite such catostrophic results, Judeas Telecoms Inc did manage to secure one Gem extraction site on a undiclosed location. Other corporations have reported sent agents to uncover where this site is located. So far, the CEO of JT Inc has remained silent on such matters, much to the frustration of it's immediate competitors",

While Mastchiff was not a direct participant in the Gem War, Mastchiff did partipate in the coroporate subterfuge and espionage theatre, as it tried to scope out the R&D works of Fen & Smith, Gaunt Corporate, and NeoBank",
        text2: "Interestingly, Mastchiff never officially expanded its hold on territory. Instead, Mastchiff aimed for market dominance of the weapons sector, in which it achieved partial success. Orbital station directors often go to Mastchiff representatives first to discuss defensive solutions to pirates, bandits and other unwanted troubles."

NeoBank forcibly siezed control of minor orbital banks to help stabilze the ensueing panic that followed in the Gem War. NeoBank operated as a lender, financier, and stakeholder in many corporations that found themselves tight in pursestrings. NeoBank is found on every orbital, planetary, and mining station. While NeoBank officially does not control 100% of all satellite bank operations, most Tenebris denizens recognize that NeoBank is inching closer to total monopolistic control of the banking sector.",
        text2: "Becuase of this, other corporations such as Mastchiff, Judeas Telecoms Inc, and UMC etc are trying to create their own subsector banks to avoid NeoBank's overeaching authority. In addition, there have been recent riots against NeoBank for leveraging high-interest rates to areas of the Tenebris sector that seemingly lost the Gem War."

The ring is divided into irregularly sized sectors, made up of everything from several small connected ships to a single large mining carrier. A lot of sectors within the Iron Ring are inhabited, either too dilapated , or just too dangerous to be in. In the inhabited sectors, salvagers, miners, and drugged cultists co-exist in the melting pot, filled with sharp smells from food stalls, ear piercing noise from workshops that constantly assemble/dissemble, and rebuild things, and the shouting of AI bodyguards offering their services in every known language.",

There are also shuttles that run between some of the sectors. most technology is recycled from old equipment. There is someone selling junk or offering cheap repairs in every corner in every sector. Society is harsh, and some do not hesitate to step on others to get a step ahead. For those that cannot afford their own living quarters, there are common areas, with rows of bed capsules placed in steel scaffolding, each capsule having room for one person.
